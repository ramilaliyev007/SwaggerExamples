I think many software developers use the Swagger. 😎 

Today, I want to show you one tip about the Swagger. 😍 

As you know, Swagger always generates a default body for requests. But the default body is sometimes invalid for the API.
In Swagger, default value is 0 for the numeric values , "𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠" is for string values and etc. 😒 

Sometimes our API'es have some data validations. Therefore, If the client sends incorrect data to API, he will get error response. In this case, I don't like give example body to every client at every time. But, there is one way to change swagger's example body. 🤔 

Do you know that we can change the default swagger example values ? 😮 

Yes, it is possible. For this purpose, we can use the 𝐒𝐰𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐥𝐞.𝐀𝐬𝐩𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞.𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 nuget package. [1] 😳 

I am demonstrating the Swagger Example in the below pictures. For the project's source code, you can visit this GitHub repository: https://lnkd.in/dwTFe4FH
